Disks can be divided into parts, called partitions.
Allows you to seperate data.

As sysadmins, you decide what kind of partitioning schemes you would use like:
1. OS, 2. Apps, 3. User,  4. Swap

or

1. OS, 2.User home directories

--------------------

[[fdisk]] is the main tool for creating pratitions.
